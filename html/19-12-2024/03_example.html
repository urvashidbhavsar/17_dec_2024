        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and
        compose text, images, and other material into
        visible
        or audible web pages. <b>Default characteristics</b> for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser,
        and
        these
        characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text
        elements
        are mentioned in the <mark><code>1988</code></mark> ISO technical report TR <code><mark>9537</mark></code>
        Techniques for
        using SGML,
        which describes
        the features
        of early
        text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early
        <mark><code>1960</code></mark>s for
        the CTSS
        (Compatible
        Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were derived from the commands used by
        typesetters to
        manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements <i><u>(nested
                annotated ranges
                with attributes)</u></i> rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has
        been
        progressively moved
        in this direction with CSS.
